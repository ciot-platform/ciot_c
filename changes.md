# ciot_c Release

### Changes

**Busy notification in ciot core:**

* Added `ciot_set_busy_handler(ciot, handler, args)`. When `ciot_iface_event_handler` drops an event with `CIOT_ERR_BUSY`, the registered handler is called with the event exactly as received; `MSG` events are still raw. Until now senders such as the ESP32 MQTT client ignored this return value, so requests dropped this way got no response. The application can now decode the event and notify the requester. Without a handler, behavior is unchanged (`include/ciot.h`, `src/core/ciot.c`).
* Both drop points call the handler: the core is `BUSY` and the event comes from another iface, or a `MSG` event arrives while the core is not `STARTED` (`STARTING` or `PENDING_EVENT`).
* The handler runs in the sender's context. On ESP32 that is the esp-mqtt or UART task, not the task running `ciot_task`.

**Fixes:**

* The "same iface" check in the `BUSY` state only runs for events that carry a decoded msg. For raw `MSG` events it read `event->msg.iface` from the union's raw bytes, and a false match could move the core to `PENDING_EVENT` and reprocess the previous event (`src/core/ciot.c`).
* `MSG` events dropped because the core is not started are now logged at error level with the iface and event (`src/core/ciot.c`).

**Version:**

* `CIOT_VER` bumped to `0.27.0.0`, opening the 0.27 alpha cycle after the v0.26.0.5 stable release.
